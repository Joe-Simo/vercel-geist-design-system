Community Agent Skills by `joe-simo`.

## Vercel Geist Design System

`vercel-geist-design-system` is a community Agent Skill for designing and reviewing Vercel-inspired interfaces with the Geist design system. It helps agents apply Geist typography, spacing, colors, materials, component styling, app shells, interaction states, screenshot audits, and UI polish across React, Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn, Radix, and other frontend surfaces.

The skill treats official Vercel sources as the design authority: Geist Font, Geist foundations, Geist component pages, Geist Brands, and the Vercel Web Interface Guidelines. Skills.sh companions are routing helpers only; they do not replace official Geist docs or prove Geist compliance by themselves.

The skill now asks agents to select the right Vercel/Geist reference archetype before designing. The Vercel homepage is a good reference for homepage, hero, launch, and broad marketing composition, but it is not the universal target. For dashboards, docs, settings, forms, tables, pricing, portfolios, app shells, and component libraries, agents should inspect comparable Vercel/Geist surfaces and mapped components, then measure composition details such as container width, section rhythm, density, typography scale, grid spans, interactions, and responsive behavior.

For existing products, the skill now includes a preservation gate: agents should restyle intentional content, routes, CTAs, brand-defining effects, credential displays, navigation, contact paths, and footer ownership before replacing or inventing alternatives. This is public guidance for any project using the skill, not a project-specific rule.

For Vercel-style grids, the skill now separates ordinary layout from intentional Vercel/Grid-style cell-and-guide art. Agents should use CSS grid/flex, columns, rows, cells, spacing, and borders for normal responsive layout. A Vercel.com-like page may use visible guide art only in a hero or isolated feature surface while the rest of the page remains a solid bordered content grid. Agents should scope visible guide-line backgrounds to the exact surface requested or shown, and use a full-page visible Grid treatment only when the user explicitly asks for it or the supplied design clearly shows guides across the whole page. The skill rejects accidental graph-paper, blueprint, or repeating-gradient decoration that sits behind unrelated UI or spreads beyond the requested surface.

The main `SKILL.md` stays compact for lower initial context use. Detailed source gates, component mappings, style rules, companion routing, and verification checks live in `skills/vercel-geist-design-system/references/` and are loaded only when relevant.

The current companion routing covers:

- Core Geist and guideline helpers: `geist`, `geistdocs`, and `web-design-guidelines`
- Implementation helpers: `building-components`, `shadcn`, React best practices, Next.js guidance, and Vercel composition patterns
- Verification helpers: browser automation, browser verification, full-flow verification, and before/after visual comparison
- Conditional surfaces: AI Elements, Streamdown, `json-render/react-three-fiber`, View Transitions, Geist learning labs, and Remotion Geist video work

The skill intentionally avoids routing Vercel platform/runtime skills for visual design work unless the user explicitly asks for that product capability.

This is community-authored by `joe-simo`. It is not an official Vercel skill.
