Community Agent Skills by `joe-simo`.

## Apple Design System

`apple-design-system` is a community Agent Skill for designing, redesigning, reviewing, and polishing Apple-style interfaces using official Apple Human Interface Guidelines and Apple Developer design resources only. It helps agents apply platform-native typography, semantic colors, layout, materials, Liquid Glass, SF Symbols, app icons, navigation, controls, component behavior, accessibility, motion, platform adaptation, responsive behavior, asset/licensing boundaries, screenshots, and UI polish across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, visionOS, SwiftUI/UIKit/AppKit-style UI, and Cupertino-style web UI.

The skill treats official Apple Developer sources as the design authority: Human Interface Guidelines, Typography, Color, Layout, Materials, SF Symbols, App Icons, Motion, Writing, Accessibility, platform HIG pages, Apple Design Resources, Apple Fonts, and Apple developer terms. It does not use third-party summaries, UI kits, templates, copied Apple screenshots, extracted private assets, or unofficial HIG mirrors as design authority.

The skill includes the same kind of enforcement structure as the Geist skill: a source-of-truth gate, official reference map, foundation gate, platform/pattern map, component documentation contract, component/interaction coverage map, asset/licensing gate, privacy/data-use gate, Apple interface craft checks, accessibility verification, and an Apple Taste Gate for screenshots, interaction checks, and final evidence.

The main `SKILL.md` stays compact for lower initial context use. Detailed source gates, foundations, platform mapping, component rules, interaction coverage, interface craft, asset/licensing checks, privacy/data-use checks, accessibility, and verification checks live in `skills/apple-design-system/references/` and are loaded only when relevant.

This is community-authored by `joe-simo`. It is not an official Apple skill and is not permission to copy Apple apps, Apple marketing, Apple icons, Apple trademarks, or private system UI.

## Awwwards-Style Web Design

`awwwards-style-web-design` is a community Agent Skill for designing and reviewing original Awwwards-style, award-caliber experiential websites. It helps agents create high-craft portfolios, agency sites, editorial microsites, campaign pages, product launches, cinematic landing pages, scroll narratives, WebGL/Three.js/R3F scenes, GSAP/Motion-style interactions, tactile transitions, typography, composition, art direction, audio/video/media, responsive layouts, accessibility, performance, and UI polish.

The skill is not a template and does not promise awards. When a user asks for a winning-level site, it interprets that as the strongest honest award-caliber candidate possible inside the project's constraints. It teaches agents to synthesize patterns from award-caliber web work into original concepts: benchmark calibration, multiple concept directions, creative-director selection, clear experience thesis, content-native interaction, bespoke art direction, motion discipline, real content, proper assets, reduced-motion fallbacks, official docs evidence, browser verification, measurable accessibility/performance checks, and production-grade implementation.

The skill includes strict originality and safety guardrails. It must not be used to clone, recreate, or closely imitate any Awwwards winner, nominee, layout, art direction, animation sequence, copy, code, brand system, logo, screenshot, video, or protected campaign concept.

This is a skill, not a plugin or template installer. It should guide original work inside the user's actual project, not clone templates, starters, boilerplates, demo apps, unofficial source code, or generated template code. Implementation guidance should come from the project itself and official library documentation.

The main `SKILL.md` stays compact for lower initial context use. Detailed originality gates, experiential foundations, craft patterns, visual/layout rules, motion/3D guidance, implementation constraints, tool/stack routing, and award-readiness verification live in `skills/awwwards-style-web-design/references/` and are loaded only when relevant.

This is community-authored by `joe-simo`. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or authorized by Awwwards.

## Vercel Geist Design System

`vercel-geist-design-system` is a community Agent Skill for designing and reviewing Vercel-inspired interfaces with the Geist design system. It helps agents apply Geist typography, spacing, colors, materials, component styling, app shells, interaction states, screenshot audits, and UI polish across React, Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn, Radix, and other frontend surfaces.

The skill treats official Vercel sources as the design authority: Geist Font, Geist foundations, Geist component pages, Geist Brands, and the Vercel Web Interface Guidelines. Skills.sh companions are routing helpers only; they do not replace official Geist docs or prove Geist compliance by themselves.

The skill now asks agents to select the right Vercel/Geist reference archetype before designing. The Vercel homepage is a good reference for homepage, hero, launch, and broad marketing composition, but it is not the universal target. For dashboards, docs, settings, forms, tables, pricing, portfolios, app shells, and component libraries, agents should inspect comparable Vercel/Geist surfaces and mapped components, then measure composition details such as container width, section rhythm, density, typography scale, grid spans, interactions, and responsive behavior.

For existing products, the skill now includes a preservation gate: agents should restyle intentional content, routes, CTAs, brand-defining effects, credential displays, navigation, contact paths, and footer ownership before replacing or inventing alternatives. This is public guidance for any project using the skill, not a project-specific rule.

For Vercel-style grids, the skill now separates ordinary layout from intentional Vercel/Grid-style cell-and-guide art. Agents should use CSS grid/flex, columns, rows, cells, spacing, and borders for normal responsive layout. A Vercel.com-like page may use visible guide art only in a hero or isolated feature surface while the rest of the page remains a solid bordered content grid. Agents should scope visible guide-line backgrounds to the exact surface requested or shown, and use a full-page visible Grid treatment only when the user explicitly asks for it or the supplied design clearly shows guides across the whole page. The skill rejects accidental graph-paper, blueprint, or repeating-gradient decoration that sits behind unrelated UI or spreads beyond the requested surface.

The main `SKILL.md` stays compact for lower initial context use. Detailed source gates, component mappings, style rules, companion routing, and verification checks live in `skills/vercel-geist-design-system/references/` and are loaded only when relevant.

The current companion routing covers:

- Core Geist and guideline helpers: `geist`, `geistdocs`, and `web-design-guidelines`
- Implementation helpers: `building-components`, `shadcn`, React best practices, Next.js guidance, and Vercel composition patterns
- Verification helpers: browser automation, browser verification, full-flow verification, and before/after visual comparison
- Conditional surfaces: AI Elements, Streamdown, `json-render/react-three-fiber`, View Transitions, Geist learning labs, and Remotion Geist video work

The skill intentionally avoids routing Vercel platform/runtime skills for visual design work unless the user explicitly asks for that product capability.
