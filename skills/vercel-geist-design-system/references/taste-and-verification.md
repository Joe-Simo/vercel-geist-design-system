## Anti-Patterns And Failure Modes

Geist is a restraint-first production style. When this skill conflicts with generic `frontend-design` guidance, this section wins. Do not apply instructions to be bold, unforgettable, maximal, experimental, surprising, ornamental, or visually striking unless the user explicitly asks for that and confirms it should override Geist. For Vercel/Geist work, differentiation comes from product clarity, precise typography, consistent tokens, and real workflow polish.

This section separates official-source checks from local Vercel/Geist taste heuristics. Official-source checks are enforceable only through the cited Geist foundation/component/brand pages or Web Interface Guidelines and can support `Docs Evidence`. Local taste heuristics are red flags for generic SaaS or template output; they do not satisfy `Docs Evidence` by themselves and must lead back to official docs before making strict Geist claims.

Reject or revise these failure modes before finishing:

- Local heuristic: generic AI SaaS visual language such as giant "accelerate/build/automate" heroes, gradient headlines, glowing blobs/orbs, glass panels, noise overlays, floating feature pills, and fake customer/logo bands.
- Local heuristic: decorative gradients, purple-blue sweeps, rainbow meshes, radial glow backgrounds, bokeh, aurora effects, spotlight blobs, or background effects that are not required by product meaning. Official check: any retained color/motion/material treatment must be justified by Colors, Materials, Animations, or Content evidence.
- Official-source check: arbitrary accent colors, multi-hue dashboards, invented dark-mode palettes, or colors chosen for mood rather than official color roles and semantic product meaning violate the consulted Colors evidence.
- Local restraint, not `Docs Evidence`: non-Geist typography such as expressive display fonts, font pairing experiments, Inter/Roboto/Space Grotesk swaps, global system-font fallbacks used as a design choice, or Geist Pixel outside a constrained display accent.
- Official-source check: reject radii that violate the consulted Materials or component page. Component-specific rounded/pill variants are allowed only when the relevant official component page documents them and the usage matches that context.
- Official-source check: composition fails only when page sections, cards inside cards, metric/list/form blocks, or app shell panels violate consulted Material, component, layout, or guideline evidence. Local heuristic: card-first or card-in-card template composition is a red flag unless tied back to official docs and user scope before strict claims.
- Local heuristic: fake product substance such as mock/sample data, fake charts, fake users, fake notifications, imaginary integrations, placeholder metrics, or seeded examples used to make the UI look busy. Use the real data path, honest empty/loading/error states, or clearly user-provided content.
- Local heuristic: marketing instead of workflow, including landing pages where an app should start, oversized hero before the usable surface, vague value props in operational screens, or "AI-powered" copy that does not describe a concrete capability. Confirm through the user's scope and Content evidence before treating it as a strict failure.
- Official-source check: animation must clarify cause/effect or add deliberate delight, respect reduced motion, avoid `transition: all`, stay interruptible/input-driven, and use CSS/compositor-friendly properties when possible. Local heuristic: avoid scroll reveals, parallax, bounce, animated gradients, cursor effects, celebratory effects, or hover surprises in ordinary product surfaces unless the user explicitly asks and official motion checks still pass.
- Local heuristic: layout spectacle such as asymmetry, overlap, diagonals, broken grids, oversized negative space, or edge-to-edge compositions that reduce scan speed in product UI.
- Local heuristic: control overload where toolbars and sidebars expose many actions before the primary workflow is obvious; group or defer advanced controls and verify with interaction/content evidence.
- Official-source check: low-contrast softness such as gray-on-gray text, subtle borders that disappear, muted controls without visible affordance, or hierarchy that relies on opacity alone violates Colors, Design, or Accessibility evidence.
- Official-source check: inconsistent primitives such as one-off colors, radii, typography classes, shadows, button sizes, focus rings, or state styles fail when they bypass consulted Geist foundations/components.
- Official-source check: brand misuse, including Vercel/Next/Turbo/v0 logos or wording that implies endorsement, affiliation, or product identity when the app is not actually that brand, violates Geist Brands evidence.

Failure handling:

- If a design starts to look like a generic AI startup template, stop and simplify: remove decorative background effects, collapse competing CTAs, reduce color to neutral plus semantic status, and put the real workflow in the first viewport.
- If the result depends on fake data to look complete, do not ship it. Wire real data, show an honest empty state, or ask the user for real content.
- If the existing project has a different visual system and the user has not made it the final visual authority, migrate or adapt the whole touched app or requested surface to Geist through shared tokens and primitives. State a blocker only when an explicit non-Geist authority or hard scope constraint makes coherent whole-surface Geist migration impossible.
- If the user asks for "more creative" without explicitly overriding Geist, increase polish through alignment, density, copy, state coverage, and interaction clarity, not through gradients, ornamental assets, or random colors.

## Vercel Taste Gate

This is a mandatory visual quality gate for any frontend task using this skill. The work is not done until evidence shows the app or verified scope passes a Vercel/Geist audit. Do not finish from code inspection alone when a local app can run.

Required audit loop when the app/code can be exercised; capture screenshots whenever a local page can run:

1. Run the local app or page through the project's normal development command and record the command plus URL.
2. Perform Scope Discovery before screenshots: inspect framework route files/config, navigation/link usage, sitemap or build route output when available, and real app entrypoints. Include Storybook/examples only when they are real app surfaces. Record inaccessible, auth-gated, environment-gated, or dynamic routes with concrete blocker reasons. Create a route/surface/state inventory before screenshots: `route/surface | discovery source | required states | mobile screenshot | laptop screenshot | desktop screenshot | ultra-wide screenshot | interaction audit | status`. For greenfield/full redesign/broad polish work, every discovered routable surface and required shared state must appear in the inventory; whole-app claims fail if any row is missing or incomplete.
3. If the app runs, attempt Browser or Playwright mobile, laptop, desktop, and ultra-wide screenshots for each inventory row. Include the first viewport and any changed states such as menus, dialogs, empty states, loading states, errors, or dense data views. Record the command, URL, viewport sizes, screenshot paths, and state. Valid screenshot blockers are limited to app cannot build/run, missing auth or environment values, browser/screenshot tool unavailable after a named attempt, or route unreachable after the discovery source was checked. If screenshots are possible and not captured, do not claim the Vercel Taste Gate passed.
4. Run an interaction audit for every changed flow using an applicability matrix: `check | pass/fail/N/A | reason/evidence`. Cover keyboard-only operation, visible `:focus-visible`/`:focus-within`, overlay initial/trapped/restored focus, Escape/Enter/Cmd/Ctrl+Enter behavior, label activation, desktop >=24px and mobile >=44px targets, URL state plus Back/Forward/refresh/scroll restoration, optimistic update rollback/Undo, tooltip timing, intentional `overscroll-behavior`, clean drag behavior, locale-aware shortcuts, browser `theme-color`/`color-scheme`, and accessibility tree names/states/hidden decoration. Applicability triggers are mandatory: overlays require focus checks; mutations require optimistic/rollback or explicit non-applicability; tooltips require timing checks when present; filters, tabs, search, pagination, expanded panels, selected views, and any visible workflow state require URL-state checks; drag/reorder features require drag checks; icon-only controls require accessibility-tree verification. Conditional checks may be `N/A` only with a specific reason tied to absent UI/behavior. Revise failures before judging screenshots.
5. Compare the rendered UI against Geist foundations and relevant Geist components from the official reference map.
6. Deterministically check for the official Web Interface Guidelines review path. In Codex, use an installed repo command or slash command only if the current agent actually supports it and a concrete command, file, or documented invocation is present. Otherwise, if network access allows, fetch and use the raw command prompt from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/main/command.md` for a manual audit. Record the exact command/file/path or raw URL used. Run the installer only with explicit user or project opt-in and record the reason. Skills.sh and raw GitHub prompts may only route or run an audit helper; they cannot supply design-system authority, cannot satisfy `Docs Evidence`, and cannot replace reading `https://vercel.com/design/guidelines` in the current turn. If none can be run, record the exact blocker and continue with the manual guidelines audit.
7. Identify every place where the UI fails the evidence-backed pass criteria or trips local generic-SaaS heuristics.
8. Revise the implementation, then inspect fresh screenshots and rerun the interaction audit.
9. Repeat until the screenshots and interaction audit pass every rule below.

Pass criteria:

- Route/surface/state inventory is complete for the verified scope, with discovery source plus mobile, laptop, desktop, and ultra-wide screenshot evidence or valid recorded blockers for every row.
- Foundation evidence is visible in implementation: Geist Sans/Mono usage, Geist Pixel only when a constrained display accent is intentionally used and otherwise verified absent, Colors roles, Typography utilities, Materials/radii, focus rings, app shell, and shared state primitives are mapped in real files and used by changed screens.
- Component evidence is visible in implementation: every UI pattern that maps to Geist has a matching component page, exact section/quote evidence, applicable Best Practices when present, and changed code that follows the documented behavior/content/accessibility rule.
- Web Interface Guidelines evidence is complete: interaction applicability matrix has pass/fail/N/A plus reasons, and failures were revised or explicitly blocked.
- Screenshots show the real product/workflow in the first viewport for every verified route/surface, not a generic landing page unless the user explicitly requested marketing.
- Screenshots and code show one coherent system: shared tokens/classes/materials/primitives are reused, and there are no isolated Geist-looking components inside unrelated styling.
- Typography uses the mapped Geist categories/utilities and does not rely on giant generic headlines, all-bold headings, or default `text-base` everywhere.
- Color uses official roles or mapped project tokens; accents appear only for brand, links, selection, status, or focus.
- Materials and radii follow consulted Materials/component evidence; depth is structural and does not rely on loud shadows, glass panels, or decorative background effects.
- Mobile, laptop, desktop, and ultra-wide screenshots preserve layout integrity: no clipped text, overlapping controls, broken grids, unwanted scrollbars, or oversized card stacks.
- Generic SaaS heuristic diff is recorded: any template-like, ornamental, overly soft, overly colorful, or disconnected areas were identified and revised, or explicitly tied to both official docs and user scope before any strict/Vercel Taste Gate claim.

Official claim blockers:

- Final answer lacks page-specific `Docs Evidence` for every official Geist/Vercel page required for the task, or cites only memory, class names, token names, screenshots, or generic Geist adjectives.
- A final answer claims visual polish or Vercel Taste Gate passage without screenshot inspection and interaction audit when those checks were possible.
- Any required applied foundation, guideline, component, or brand row is missing, blocked, lacks an exact section/anchor, or lacks a page-specific short quote that affected a concrete decision.
- Any Web Interface Guidelines interaction failure remains unrevised without a concrete blocker.

Local anti-template heuristics:

These require revision or explicit user-scope plus official-doc justification before strict claims, but they are not official Geist violations by themselves and do not satisfy `Docs Evidence`.

- Purple-blue gradient SaaS aesthetic.
- Decorative orbs, bokeh blobs, aurora backgrounds, or ornamental SVG filler.
- Oversized rounded cards used as page sections.
- Card-in-card layouts.
- Heavy drop shadows or glassy panels.
- Fake sample data added only to make the UI look populated.
- Marketing copy inside product workflows.
- Dozens of visible controls before the primary task is clear.
- Mixed visual systems where only isolated buttons or cards look Geist-like.

If the app cannot be run, screenshots cannot be captured, or interaction checks cannot be performed, say that explicitly in the final response and do not claim the Vercel Taste Gate passed. If screenshots and interaction checks are possible, the final response must include the audit evidence: dev command, URL, mobile/laptop/desktop/ultra-wide viewport sizes, screenshot paths, changed states inspected, interaction applicability matrix summary, blockers, and revision decisions made because of the audits. Use an inspection method instead of screenshot paths only when screenshot capture is blocked, and then do not claim the Vercel Taste Gate passed.

Failure response:

- If any pass criterion fails and the file is editable, make another revision.
- If the failure cannot be fixed without user input or external access, explain the exact blocker and the closest safe fallback.
- In the final response, briefly state which checks ran and whether any visual verification was blocked.

## Final Verification Checklist

Before finishing any task using this skill that creates, changes, critiques, specifies, or materially directs rendered UI, verify:

- The first viewport shows the real product/workflow, not a generic landing page unless explicitly requested.
- Verification scope is explicit: greenfield/full redesign/broad polish covers all routable app surfaces; narrow existing-project work covers the requested workflow and touched shared primitives, and the final response says `whole app not verified` unless every route/surface was audited.
- The Geist foundation gate was completed before screen design: fonts, tokens, typography utilities, material/radius utilities, focus rings, app shell, required component primitives, shared state system, and screen composition rules are wired through real app entrypoints, theme/Tailwind/CSS files, shared primitives, and app shell, and consumed by changed screens.
- Screen-level styles compose shared Geist foundations, primitives, and state APIs/classes; they do not introduce one-off colors, font stacks, radii, focus rings, shadows, state styles, or component behavior.
- Strict Geist work uses local Geist Sans and Geist Mono. Non-Geist font replacements are allowed only after an explicit non-Geist visual-system override, and those surfaces cannot be claimed as strict/docs-verified Geist. Geist Pixel is installed/loaded only if a display accent uses it, and it is absent from ordinary product UI text.
- Typography uses official Geist classes or mapped equivalents for headings, buttons, labels, copy, mono, and tabular numeric text.
- Color roles use official Geist/Core tokens or custom raw Geist scale variables before semantic aliases such as `background`, `foreground`, `muted-foreground`, `border`, `ring`, `link`, `info`, `destructive`, `success`, and `warning`. Any `accent` alias resolves to a specific official Geist role/scale for focus, selection, link, or status; default/primary actions follow the consulted Button/component page.
- Chart/status palettes use redundant cues and color-blind-friendly choices, APCA contrast is checked where available, and hover/active/focus states increase contrast over rest state.
- Materials use the official 6px, 12px, and 16px radius scale or mapped project tokens.
- Every UI pattern that exists in Geist was checked against its Geist reference before custom implementation.
- Official Geist/Vercel pages required for the task are listed in a page-specific `Docs Evidence` table in the final response in all cases: consulted rows when read, blocked rows with exact tool failures when docs access fails, and the fallback label `local Geist fallback, not docs-verified` for affected surfaces.
- Relevant component pages' Best Practices were followed, not just visual styling.
- Vercel Web Interface Guidelines were applied for keyboard behavior, focus, hit targets, URL state, optimistic updates, tooltip timing, overscroll containment, clean drag behavior, locale-aware shortcuts, mobile inputs, states, copy, numerals/units, performance-relevant UI, `theme-color`, and `color-scheme`.
- The app shell, navigation, forms, tables/lists, dialogs, menus, toasts, loading, empty, error, and no-dead-end recovery paths all share the same audited Geist tokens, typography utilities, materials, primitives, state rules, root background, gutters, header/sidebar/nav structure, dividers, max-width behavior, mobile behavior, one primary action zone, skip-to-content, valid heading hierarchy, and context-specific `<title>`.
- Interactive controls have hover, active/pressed, selected/current, disabled, loading, validation, error, focus-visible, and reduced-motion states as relevant.
- Tables, lists, forms, and screens have loading, empty, error, no-results, validation, and recovery states as relevant.
- Desktop, mobile, laptop, and ultra-wide views were inspected when a local app can run; layouts do not overlap, clip text, shift unpredictably, create unwanted scrollbars, or break safe-area insets.
- Local anti-template heuristics such as generic SaaS gradients, decorative orbs, card-in-card sections, fake sample data, and unrelated visual styles are absent or revised; retained exceptions are tied to both explicit user scope and official docs, otherwise no strict/Vercel Taste Gate claim is made.
